I am researching the sales performance of electronic products in the market. I have collected various complex market sales data, but our company's product classification is different from the market classification. You need to help me complete this conversion. The 'Methodology' worksheet describes the conversion relationships, where the first row corresponds to the original data classification method, and the first column corresponds to our company's internal classification method. The 'RawData' worksheet contains detailed data for all product categories. This file is located at `Market_Data.xlsx` in the workspace. You need to convert the raw data according to the company's internal classification, then further calculate the annual sales growth rate for specific categories (as well as the growth rate of the corresponding raw data). Please pay attention to the units in the raw data. Create a new file named `growth_rate.xlsx` in the workspace, and you need to ensure that `growth_rate.xlsx` can be loaded with `load_workbook(file_path, data_only=True)`. Please refer to the format of the `Market_Data_Format.xlsx` file.

**Note:** Please check the `task_specific_cn.md` file in the workspace to understand the specific target category and time range for this task.
